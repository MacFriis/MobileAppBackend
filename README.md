  # Mobile Backend with Web Frontend

This template is a boilerplate for a mobile backend, including all the basics to get started with authentication and essential endpoints. It also includes a web frontend, which can be omitted if not needed.


```mermaid
graph TD;
    subgraph Backend
        API[REST API] -->|Uses| Share[(Shared Data Layer)];
    end

    subgraph Frontend
        Web[Blazor Web App] -->|Uses| Share;
    end

    Mobile[Mobile App] -->|Calls| API;
```

## API

The API is based on a REST architecture, primarily designed for mobile app connections.

### Features

- Sign in with Apple
- Sign in with Google (not implemented yet)
- Sign in with ... (to be determined)
- Sign in with username and password

### Endpoints

#### **UsersController**
- **GET /profile** ‚Äì Returns the user's profile.
- **PUT /profile** ‚Äì Replaces the current profile, except for credentials such as username, password, and tokens.
- **DELETE /profile** ‚Äì Deletes the user profile.

#### **GdprController**
- **GET /all** ‚Äì Returns all registered data. Needs to be updated when implementing additional data storage.
- **DELETE /data** ‚Äì Deletes all stored user data without the possibility of recovery. This does not handle database backups, which must be implemented separately.

## Web Frontend

This is a standard **Blazor** web app, **server-rendered**, using **Bootstrap** for styling. 

The basic sign-in features are implemented using Microsoft's standard login setup.
